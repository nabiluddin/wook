        The Wookiee coin pays tribute to the iconic Wookiee meme and is not associated with any products, videos, productions, films or animation studios. The token is a nod to a beloved alien that is widely recognized and appreciated. WOOKIEE is a cryptocurrency based on a meme that has no inherent value or guarantee of financial return. It is in fact very risky to buy if you are looking for financial rewards. Participate only a meme enthusiast and collector rather than a speculator of future value. The coin does not have a formal team or a specific roadmap for development. There are some things outlined, but those are only bonus activities and may never come to fruition. It is a non-functional coin and exists solely for entertainment purposes. $WOOKIEE is not an investment of any form. Do not buy this expecting financial returns. Always consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
